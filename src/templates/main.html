Satellite data shows that some of the highest concentrations of fires occurred on land earmarked as corporate concessions where fast-growing trees will be planted to produce pulpwood for paper products and palm oil, of which Indonesia is the world's largest producer.  </p>

Sinar Mas is itself a subsidiary of GAR (Golden Agri-Resources) which, in 2014, was one of five major producers that signed the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) committing themselves to sustainable practices and zero-deforestation. However, with up to 40% of oil palm sourced from smallholder farmers, corporate oversight of practices lower down the supply chain is fragmentary.</p>

        <p>Many of the fires burned on dried-out carbon-rich peatland which meant Indonesia was responsible for massive carbon dioxide emissions at the height of the fires. Typically, according to figures from the World Resources Institute, Indonesia emits 2.1 megatons of carbon dioxide a day (the US emits almost 16 megatons, and China 29.3). Bloomberg calculated that Indonesia's average daily carbon dioxide emissions in October were 23 megatons (the US emits almost 16 megatons, and China 29.3). On 14 October, emissions from the fires alone soared to 61 megatons, almost 97% of the country’s total emissions. Total emissions from the fires also overtook the annual emissions of the German and Japanese economies.</p>
        <p>Indonesia's peatland areas are naturally fire-resistant but years of bad management practices have drained the peat leaving them vulnerable to ignition during dry spells. Once alight, dry peatland fires are particularly difficult to extinguish as they can smoulder underground for months and then resurface in a different place.</p>
